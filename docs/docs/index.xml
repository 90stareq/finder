      <description>Authentication is a key component of Fider platform. We take security and usability very seriously, which is why we&amp;rsquo;ve decided to go with Social sign in as the main authentication method.
Setup is very easy and fast.
Facebook  Create a facebook app at https://developers.facebook.com/apps. Set OAUTH_FACEBOOK_APPID and OAUTH_FACEBOOK_SECRET environment variables.  Google  Create a facebook app at https://console.developers.google.com. Callback URL for Google apps is http://&amp;lt;yoursite.com&amp;gt;/oauth/google/callback. Note that it can be either http or https, that depends on your setup.</description>
