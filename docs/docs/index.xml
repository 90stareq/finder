      <description>Prerequisites We highly recommend using Docker to host the application. It&#39;s the easiest and fastest way to get started and stay up to date with any future release.
You&#39;ll also need a Postgres 9.6+ database, which could also be hosted on Docker, but that&#39;s not required.

      <description>Why is this required? Authentication is a key component of Fider platform. We take security and usability very seriously, which is why we&amp;rsquo;ve decided to go with Social sign in as the main authentication method. If you&amp;rsquo;ve just got started with Fider, you&amp;rsquo;ll need a Facebook and/or a Google app to get authentication to work.
But don&amp;rsquo;t worry, it&amp;rsquo;s a very easy and fast setup explained below.
