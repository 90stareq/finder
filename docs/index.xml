      <description>Configuring Social OAuth Authentication is a key component of Fider platform. We take security and usability very seriously, which is why we&amp;rsquo;ve decided to go with Social sign in as the main authentication method.
Setup is very easy and fast.
Facebook  Create a facebook app at https://developers.facebook.com/apps. Set OAUTH_FACEBOOK_APPID and OAUTH_FACEBOOK_SECRET environment variables.  Google  Create a facebook app at https://console.developers.google.com. Callback URL for Google apps is http://&amp;lt;yoursite.com&amp;gt;/oauth/google/callback. Note that it can be either http or https, that depends on your setup.</description>

      <description>Prerequisites In order to configure HTTPS, you&amp;rsquo;ll need a Certificate and the Private Key.
How to enable it Fider v0.3.0 shipped with two new environment variables that you&amp;rsquo;ll need to set.
 SSL_CERT: This is the path to the Certificate file. SSL_CERT_KEY: This is the path to the Private Key file.  If you&amp;rsquo;re using Docker, these files won&amp;rsquo;t be inside the container, but Fider will need to have access to it.</description>
