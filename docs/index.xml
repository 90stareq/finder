      <title>Hosting your own instance</title>

      <description>Prerequisites We highly recommend using Docker to host the application. It&#39;s the easiest and fastest way to get started and stay up to date with any future release.
You&#39;ll also need:
  PostgreSQL 9.6 Database This tutorial uses a Docker PostgreSQL image for the sake of simplicity, but we highly recommend you to use a database outside Docker.
  E-mail sender service: You can choose to use either a SMTP Server or a Mailgun account.</description>

      <guid>https://getfider.com/blog/version-0.14.0/</guid>
      <description>In this release we&amp;rsquo;ve focused on technical improvements, but we managed to deliver minor features as well. This is a necessary step towards building a product that can be further enhanced with new features.
#1: Filter ideas that I voted We&amp;rsquo;ve included a new filter option: My Votes. This option will show all ideas that the current signed in user has already voted on. It is only available for signed in users</description>

      <title>Fider 0.13 released with custom branding and legal compliance</title>
      <link>https://getfider.com/blog/version-0.13.0/</link>

      <guid>https://getfider.com/blog/version-0.13.0/</guid>
      <description>#1: Custom Branding First thing we&amp;rsquo;d like to highlight is that administratrors are now able to upload a logo for the site. This logo is shown on different places, like the Header, the error pages, favicon and also on social links. We highly recommend everyone to upload a company/product logo as this will result in a much nicer social sharing experience.
  The other big addition is the Custom CSS, which allows administrators to write their own CSS to change the design of nearly everything on the site.</description>

      <description>Introduction We&amp;rsquo;re super excited about this release! Private site was a highly requested feature that brings a lot of value in some particular situations. This feature open a range of possibilities on how people can leverage Fider on their projects and organizations.
Aside from that, we&amp;rsquo;re also shipping a built-in option to export all your ideas to a CSV. This can be particularly useful if you want to do some analysis on an external tool like Excel or any of your favorite Business Intelligence tool.</description>

      <title>Fider 0.11 released with option to edit and delete ideas</title>
      <link>https://getfider.com/blog/version-0.11.0/</link>

      <description>Introduction It&amp;rsquo;s very well known that as the size of the codebase grows, so does the complexity and time needed to maintain it. This is a common characteristic of most software programs and thus, not different for Fider.
As we evolve one version a month we need to always look back and improve older code, even those small pieces that are still working sometimes needs some love. Refactoring older code to make it easier to read, maintain and change is something we&amp;rsquo;ll be doing more often moving forward.</description>

      <title>Fider 0.10 released with notifications system and more</title>
      <link>https://getfider.com/blog/version-0.10.0/</link>

      <description>1. Web and Email Notifications This has been, for a long time, the most wanted feature of Fider. The notification system is based on a subscription model where users are only notified about ideas they subscribed to. This can be done manually by clicking on &amp;ldquo;Subscribe&amp;rdquo; or automatically whenever they vote or comment on it.
As for Collaborators and Administrators, they automatically subscribe to all ideas, although it&amp;rsquo;s possible to unsubscribe from each idea individually.</description>

      <description>1. Merge duplicate ideas It&amp;rsquo;s now possible to mark an idea as a Duplicate of another idea. This is particular useful to clean up the ideas list when someone shares an idea that has already been posted before.
When an idea is marked as a duplicate, it will show a link to the original idea and all its votes will be added to it as well.
  2. Sort by trending Fider now shows trending ideas by default instead of recent ones.</description>

      <description>1. Assign tag to posts Our recent most wanted feature has been implemented. Starting from this release, administrators are able to create tags and assign tags to posts.
  Tags can be either Public or Private. Private tags are especially helpful for administrators to organize their posts without leaking any information publicly.
Tags can also be used to filter posts, alongside with the new free text search box.</description>

      <description>1. Add/Remove Members This feature has been suggested during the month and received a few votes on a short amount of time. This is a really basic feature that we were missing and now we&amp;rsquo;re happy to ship the first version of it on this release.
  2. Technical Improvements This release was all about Technical Improvements. We&amp;rsquo;ve removed echo, updated React to v16, increased code coverage, removed other dependencies and refactored a lot of code.</description>

      <title>Fider 0.6 released with sign in by email</title>
      <link>https://getfider.com/blog/version-0.6.0/</link>

      <guid>https://getfider.com/blog/version-0.6.0/</guid>
      <description>1. Sign in by email We heard more than once that required users to use their Social accounts to sign in is not the way to go. Some people might not have these accounts or don&amp;rsquo;t want to link they because of privacy concerns, which is totally understandable!
With this in mind, we are happy to release v0.6.0 with a very simple sign in by email process. There&amp;rsquo;s no need for users to fill in any form, all they need to do is type their email and click on the link that we send.</description>

Google  Create a facebook app at https://console.developers.google.com. Callback URL for Google apps is http://&amp;lt;yoursite.com&amp;gt;/oauth/google/callback.
