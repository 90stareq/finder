      <description>Fider v0.3.0 has just been released and includes following features:
1. Staff now can add official response to ideas In you&amp;rsquo;re part of the Staff of a tenant, you&amp;rsquo;ll now see a Respond button where you can give your official status on what&amp;rsquo;s the plan for that idea. As of now, we&amp;rsquo;re currently supporting the following status: New, Started, Completed and Declined.
  2. Much simpler Sign up / Installation process On previous versions, installing a new Fider instance required some SQL commands to be run.</description>
