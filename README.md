## Welcome! 

WeCanHearYou is an open source, cross platform and free to use feedback system for companies and products.

### Current stage

I'm currently bootstraping both API & Web UI of the application, so there isn't much to see. You can keep track of its progress using our [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/WeCanHearYou).

#### Live environment

Our staging environment is hosted by Heroku and it's automatically deployed upon commit on master.

- API Status: [http://api.staging.canhearyou.com/status](http://api.staging.canhearyou.com/status)
- Web UI: [http://demo.staging.canhearyou.com](demo.staging.canhearyou.com)

### How to install it

- Linux/Windows server running **Go 1.6+** for the API: [https://github.com/WeCanHearYou/wchy-api](/WeCanHearYou/wchy-api);
- Linux/Windows server running **Node.js 6+** for the Web UI: [https://github.com/WeCanHearYou/wchy-web](/WeCanHearYou/wchy-web);
- A **PostgreSQL** database;

We plan to add Docker support on a later stage.

### Thank you for the visit, hope to see you soon again :)
