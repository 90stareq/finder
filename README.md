## Welcome! 

WeCanHearYou is an open source, cross platform and free to use feedback system for companies and products.

### Current stage

I'm currently bootstraping both API & Web UI of the application, so there isn't much to see. You can keep track of its progress using our [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/WeCanHearYou).

#### Live environment

Our staging environment is hosted by Heroku and it's automatically deployed upon commit on dev/master.

- Demo: [http://orange.staging.canhearyou.com](orange.staging.canhearyou.com)

### How to install it

- Linux/Windows server running **Go 1.6+**: [https://github.com/WeCanHearYou/wchy-api](/WeCanHearYou/wchy);
- A **PostgreSQL** database;

We plan to add Docker support on a later stage.

### Thank you for the visit, hope to see you soon again :)
